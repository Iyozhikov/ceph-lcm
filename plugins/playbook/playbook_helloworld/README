This is a Hello world plugin for Decapod.

It's main intention is to be a generic plugin which installs something
on the host and run some service. This plugin installs simpliest WSGI
application on remote host and starts server. After that, application
respond with '{"result": "ok"}' JSON on any request.

It has 2 options to setup:

  - interface
    This is a interface to bind to. If you want to have it accessible
    on any interface, use '0.0.0.0' as usual.
  - port_number
    This is a number of port for server to bind to.
