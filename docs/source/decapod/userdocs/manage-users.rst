============
Manage users
============

**To add a new user:**

#. Log in to the Decapod web UI.
#. Navigate to :guilabel:`USERS MANAGEMENT`.
#. Click the :guilabel:`USERS` tab.
#. Click :guilabel:`CREATE NEW USER` and type the required data.
#. Click :guilabel:`SAVE`.
   A new user has been created.

   .. note::

      The password is sent to the user email. This password can be changed.

After saving the changes, you will see that the :guilabel:`CHANGELOG` is
updated. This :guilabel:`CHANGELOG` tracks all the results and it is possible
to view the details about a user modifications. This is related not only to
the user management. Decapod stores all changes and you can always obtain the
entire log.

Clicking :guilabel:`DELETE USER` does not delete the user but archives it
instead. You can still access the user through the Decapod CLI if you know the
user ID.
