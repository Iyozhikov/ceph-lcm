Upgrade Decapod
===============

Before starting any upgrade procedure, perform a backup of Decapod.
The upgrade procedure is consequent, which means before upgrading to the
latest version, you must first upgrade to the next version. For example, to
upgrade Decapod from version *X* to *X+3*, first upgrade to *X+1*, then to
*X+2*, and only then to *X+3*.
