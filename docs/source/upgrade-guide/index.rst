Upgrade Guide
=============

This chapter describes in details how to upgrade Decapod from one
version to another. Please backup before starting any upgrade procedure.
Also, please pay attention that in most cases (if there are no explicit
chapters or recommendations) upgrade is possible only from previous
version to current one. If you are going to upgrade from version *X* to
version *X+3*, you need to upgrade to *X+1* first, then to *X+2* and
only after that to *X+3*.
